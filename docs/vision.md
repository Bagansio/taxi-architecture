# Vision

Vision for the future of our taxi company data platform, what are going to be
important pillars and elements that we should focus on in the next 2-3 years.

1. GCP to k8s
2. AI Operations
3. Feedback loop

### 1. GCP to K8s

If the platform keeps growing instead using all gcp services start using k8s clusters to have our own kafka, apis, jobs, consumers (dataflows), caches, and specific jobs such as AI jobs, having our own AI models or technologies, or train our own models using nodes with graphic cards.

This also allows to collect all APIs into API gateways easier, and generate personal PAAS images to develop faster with our own common libraries, and being more secure and robust.

### 2. AI Operations

Keep improving predictions to reduce risks, improve taxi positions/taxi routes (based on historical trips, weather, local events), use different AI technologies such as LLM to help taxi drivers use some features keeping the eyes on the road, or chat support to users.

### 3. Feedback loop

Listen taxi drivers, managers, users feedback to add new services, features, or improving existing ones.

For example a service to taxi managers to monitorize region taxis and organize better the taxi fleet.

New user features such as emails to users with discounts, receipts...

New taxi features such as key/secret commands to send specific alerts that could call to police in some scenarios...
